In order to test the  renderer execute 

c:\langs\ipromotion\promorenderer>.\promorenderer.exe --width=200 --height=200 --streamport=8000 --listenerport=8100 --x3dfile=c:/langs/ipromotion/Audi_Interactive/Audi.x3d


This way the renderer is able to accept rest calls.

They are the same as promonode, the main difference is that no user is active so, replace

/{user-id} with /player

In the above example it is

http://localhost:8100/player/---REST END POINTS ---

the stream is on 8000
